Define Reflection
		<p>The definition given here is the most common one, but there are other interesting approaches.</p>
		<p>For instance, the PCMI online course begins from assumptions that are more basic:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>For any rigid motion, the image of a line, ray or segment is, respectively, a line, ray or segment.</li>
			<li>For any line `m`, there is a rigid motion `R_m` called reflection across `m`. This `R_m` fixes every point of `m` but no other points are fixed.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>From these two assumptions the PCMI approach is to prove what we're taking as the definition of reflection: that for every point `P` not on `m`, `m` is the perpendicular bisector of segment `overline(PR_m(P))`. This earlier starting place is more satisfying theoretically, but adds a level of complexity thatâ€™s probably not useful for most secondary students.</p>
