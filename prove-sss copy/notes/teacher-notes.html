	<h4>Lesson Launch</h4>
	<p>Estimated time: 5 minutes</p>
	<p>As part of your lesson launch, tell students that this lesson focuses on triangle congruence, and that for shapes to be congruent, there must be a way to transform one to fit exactly on top of the other, without changing any lengths or angles. Remind students that transformations that preserve lengths and angles are called isometries, and ask several different students to name one isometry that they've studied. Ideally students can name four isometries of the plane: translation, rotation, reflection, and glide reflection. (Students in most classes are unlikely to name the fifth group member, the identity transformation, and there's no reason to bring it up now.)</p>
	<p>Also tell students that they can prove the SSS Theorem using only one transformation (reflection), which will help to make their proof clearer and understandable. To use reflection effectively, the lesson will start with two activities to review some critical information about reflection: the meaning of its definition, and the Perpendicular Bisector Theorem, which relates reflection to perpendicular bisectors.</p>
	<p>Finally, ask students to name some techniques they use when they have a hard problem to solve. Responses might include "break it down into parts", "draw a picture", "work backwards", and "solve a simpler problem first." In the third activity of the lesson, students solve a simpler problem first: instead of putting two triangles into superposition, they put two segments into superposition.</p>
	<p>Once they've superposed two segments, students have the tools they'll need to be successful in constructing a proof of the SSS theorem</p>
	<p>If time is short, consider doing the Define Reflection activity as a whole-class investigation. Talk a student through the construction and help students draw the appropriate conclusion from both page 1 and page 2.</p>
