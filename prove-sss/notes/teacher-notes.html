	<h4>Lesson Launch</h4>
	<p>Estimated time: 5 minutes</p>
	<p>As part of your lesson launch, tell students that this lesson focuses on triangle congruence, and that for shapes to be congruent, there must be a way to transform one to fit exactly on top of the other, without changing any lengths or angles. Remind students that transformations that preserve lengths and angles are called isometries, and ask several different students to name one isometry that they've studied. Ideally students can name four isometries of the plane: translation, rotation, reflection, and glide reflection. (Students in most classes are unlikely to name the fifth group member, the identity transformation, and there's no reason to bring it up now.)</p>
	<p>Also tell students that they can prove the SSS Theorem using only one transformation (reflection), which will help to make their proof clearer and understandable. To use reflection effectively, the lesson will start with two activities to review some critical information about reflection: the meaning of its definition, and the Perpendicular Bisector Theorem, which relates reflection to perpendicular bisectors.</p>
	<p>Finally, ask students to name some techniques they use when they have a hard problem to solve. Responses might include "break it down into parts", "draw a picture", "work backwards", and "solve a simpler problem first." In the third activity of the lesson, students solve a simpler problem first: instead of putting two triangles into superposition, they put two segments into superposition.</p>
	<p>Once they've superposed two segments, students have the tools they'll need to be successful in constructing a proof of the SSS theorem</p>
	<p>If time is short, consider doing the Define Reflection activity as a whole-class investigation. Talk a student through the construction and help students draw the appropriate conclusion from both page 1 and page 2.</p>

Prove the Segment Congruence Theorem
	<p>Estimated time: 25 minutes</p>
	<p>This sketch scaffolds students’ development and understanding of the proof of the Segment Congruence Theorem. (Each tool use produces a box along the bottom of the screen, showing the construction steps. These boxes help the teacher see the steps students took; more importantly they allow students to formulate a logically-structured proof by mentally recreating their construction as recorded in the boxes. Because each tool implements a specific geometric definition, postulate, or theorem, the boxes also help students identify the reasoning behind each step of their proof.)</p>
	<p>The first three pages of this sketch require two reflections, addressing the general case, and supporting a simple, logical strategy: reflect `A` onto `C`, and then reflect `B` onto `D` without disturbing the superposition of `A` on `C`. Pages 4 and 5 show segments that are already reflected images, so the same double-reflection method won't work. But rather than start from scratch with new proof strategy for this case, students are encouraged to consider first performing an arbitary reflection on `overline(AB)` (restoring the general case) and then use the same double-reflection strategy with which they're already familiar.</p>
	<p>Here's the logical sequence of the five pages of this sketch:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Any two segments of equal length can be put into superposition by at most two reflections. The page 1 segments reauire two reflections, allowing students to use a simple strategy: superpose A on D, then B on E. The segments are constructed to be always congruent, so students can drag the points to test whether their constructions are robust.  </li>
		<li>On this page students must enforce the given (the facts that the segments are of equal length). They see that the construction they used on page 1 doesn't work without enforcing the given: after superposing `A'` on `C`, the second reflection (to superpose `B''` on `D`) doesn't work, because it disturbs the superposition of `A` on `C`. By enforcing the given fact that `AB=CD`, students can argue that `A'B'=CD`, so the superposed point `A'C` must lie on the perpendicular bisector of `overline(B'D)`.</li>
		<li>On this page students again construct the double reflection to superpose `overline(AB)` on `overline(CD)`, this time paying close attention to the question of when does it make the most sense to enforce the given of the proof. Some students may argue for enforcing the given before beginning any other construction, while others might prefer to enforce it just before it's required to make the second perpendicular bisector pass through the already-superposed points, and still others might argue that it's better to see that the perpendicular bisector construction actually misses the superposed points and that enforcing the givens fixes the problem.</li>
		<li>On this page the two triangles are already reflected images; the double-reflection strategy doesn't work. If students try it, they end up with the two segments superposed after just a single reflections, but then they need to produce a significantly different argument as to why the first reflection has the effect of putting the both pairs of points into superposition. A simpler alternative is to perform an arbitrary reflection of `ovderline(AB)` and then applying the double-reflection strategy that they've already used.</li>
		<li>On this page students begin with a different pair of the same special case, prepare using an arbitrary reflection of `overline(AB)`, and then use the double-reflection strategy (again attending to the "best" stage at which to enforce each given.</li>
	</ol>
	
	
	<p>Detailed notes: to be written</p>
	<p>This version of the Congruent Segments activity does a better job of connecting the given fact about distance measurements (`AB = CD`) with the construction task of superposing `overline(AB)` on `overline(CD)`. The steps of this construction task appear at the bottom of the sketch window as you do the construction. These construction steps correspond to the logical steps of the proof of the Segment Congruence Theorem: Given `AB = CD`, the image of `overline(AB)` can be superposed on `overline(CD)`. Because <em>congruence</em> is defined in terms of superposition, this is equivalent to saying “Given two segments of equal length, the segments are congruent.”</p>
	<p>(It's important to note, when proving congruence by superposition, that the transformations used must be those that preserve distances: reflection, rotation, translation, and glide reflection.)</p>
	
Superpose SSS Triangles
	<p>Estimated time: 30  minutes</p>
	<p>This sketch scaffolds students’ development and understanding of the proof of the SSS Theorem.</p>
	<p>The first three pages of this sketch (with opposite-handed triangles) require three reflections. Though this is the maximum number of reflections, it's the best place to start because each reflection can be used to superpose one pair of corresponding vertices. Pages 4 and 5 show similiarly-handed triangles, so the same triple-reflection method won't work. But rather than start from scratch with an entirely new proof strategy for this case, students are encouraged to consider first performing an arbitary reflection on `triABC`, resulting in opposite-handed triangles, and then use the same triple-reflection strategy with which they're already familiar.</p>
	<p>Here's the logical sequence of the six pages of this sketch:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Any two SSS triangles (triangles with corresponding sides of equal length) can be put into superposition by at most three reflections. The page 1 triangles reauire all three reflections, allowing students to use a simple strategy: superpose A on D, then B on E, and finally C on F. The triangles are constructed to be always congruent, so students can drag vertices A, B, and C to test whether their constructions are robust.  </li>
		<li>On this page students must enforce the givens (the facts that the corresponding sides are of equal length). They see that the constructions they used on page 1 don't work without enforcing the givens. For instance, if a student uses a reflection to superpose A' on D and then a second reflection to superpose B'' on E, the result is that A'' is no longer superposed on D. By enforcing the given fact that AB=DE, students can argue that A'B'=DE, so the superposed point A'D must lie on the perpendicular bisector of `overline(B'E)`.</li>
		<li>On this page students again construct the triple reflection to superpose `triABC` on `triDEF`, this time paying close attention to the question of when does it make the most sense to enforce the givens of the proof. Some students may argue for enforcing all three givens before beginning any other construction, while others might prefer to enforce each given just before it's required to make the next perpendicular bisector pass through the already-superposed points, and still others might argue that it's better to see that the perpendicular bisector construction actually misses the superposed points and that enforcing the givens fixes the problem.</li>
		<li>On this page the two triangles are similarly-handed; the triple-reflection strategy doesn't work. If students try it, they end up with the two triangles superposed after just two reflections, but then they need to produce a significantly different argument as to why the second reflection has the effect of also putting the third pair of vertices into superposition. A simpler alternative is to perform an arbitrary reflection of `triABC` and then applying the triple-reflection strategy that they've already used.</li>
		<li>On this page students begin with a different pair of similarly-handed triangles, prepare using an arbitrary reflection of `triABC`, and then use the triple-reflection strategy (again attending to the "best" stage at which to enforce each given.</li>
		<li>On this page students encounter yet another case: opposite-handed triangles tbat are brought into superpositon by a single reflection. Students can either grapple with yet another different case, or they can prepare `triABC` by performing two arbitrary reflections and then once more use the triple-reflection strategy.</li>
