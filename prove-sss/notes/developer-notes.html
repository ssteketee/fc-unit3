	<h4>Lesson Revisions Needed</h4>
	<div class="jaxContainer">
	<p>This activity needs substantial revision. The first three activities in the lesson should be rewritten and moved into (probably two) earlier lessons, one on Perpendicular Bisectors and the Reflect Function and one on the Segment Congruence Theorem. The first lesson explores two aspects of the perpendicular bisector: its role in defining the reflect function, and the Perpendicular Bisector Theorem. The current third activity, on the Segment Congruence Theorem, deserves its own lesson. (Perhaps these two might be combined into a single lesson.)</p>
	<p>With these two lessons under their belts,students should be prepared for the following sequence of activities in the SSS Theorem lesson:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>A first SSS activity in which the triangles already have the givens enforced, so that their corresponding sides always remain of equal length. This activity has four pages, one for each transformation. Students will note that two of the pages require an odd number of reflections to superpose the triangles, two require an even number, and that even/odd is determined by the relative handedness of the triangles. Students will become comfortable with the use of the tools to superpose the image of `triABC` on `triDEF`. Students will also learn they never need more than three reflections to construct the required superposition.</li>
		<li>The second SSS activity further explores the hard case that requires three reflections (glide reflection). Page 1 reviews what they already did in the previous activity (an opposite-handed pair of triangles with the corresponding sides constructed to be equal in length). On pages 2 and 3 they will have opposite-handed triangles that do not initially satisfy the given conditions, and they will explore and describe what goes wrong with the three-reflection construction. On page 2 `overline(AB)` and `overline(DE)` start as congruent, but the other sides don't. On page 3 none of the sides are congruent to start with. By connecting these pages with their experiences with the Segment Congruence Theorem, students will explain why they must use the <em>Make AB=DE</em> tool on page 3 to guarantee that the second reflection doesn't disturb the superposition of A on D. Page 4 is another practice problem similar to page 3. Students end with a good idea of the necessary steps. A class discussion reveals that different students may have used the "make equal" tools at different times, and that describing the effect of the <em>Make AB=DE</em> tool has two elements: not only does it make the triangle satisfy one of the given conditions, that `AB = DE`, but it also guarantees that once `A'` has been superposed on D, the perpendicular bisector of `overline(B'E)` must pass through that superposed point, leaving the superposition unchanged. In other words, it guarantees that the second reflection will leave point `A''` superposed on `D`.</li>
		<li>Discussion following this activity should address the different ways students can accomplish the construction (after all, the givens can be enforced at any point in time during the construction), and on the idea that a convincing argument for the truth of the SSS Theorem must explain why these given equal-length facts make the superposition construction work. A significant part of the discussion should be different students' different ways of explaining this: they've already seen that when the segments aren't equal, the perpendicular bisector of `overline(B'E)` doesn't go through the first superposed point, but they will have different approaches to arguing why it is that making the segments equal guarantees the perpendicular bisector goes through the desired point. Some students will make arguments based on the idea that with `A'` and `D` superposed, `the triangle`triB'DE` (which can also be written as `triB'A'E` will be isosceles only if `AB=DE`, and that if it's not isosceles then the perpendicular bisector of `B'E` cannot go through the third vertex. Other students will begin with the properties of perpendicular bisectors, observing that a point ]\`P`is equally distant from two other points `Q` and `R` if and only if it lies on the perpendicular bisector of `overline(QR)`. </li>

	<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
	<p>Begin with a short activity that reviews what students can use to prove SSS:</p><ol>
		<li>Definition of Reflected Image: The reflected image of `A` in line `m` is `A` itself (if `A` lies on `m`). If `A` does not lie on `m`, the reflected image of `A` is the point `B` such that `m` is the perpendicular bisector of `overline(AB)`.</li>
		<li>This definition allows you to find the mirror given a point `A` and its reflected image `B`. (Perpendicular Bisector tool)</li>
		<li>It also allows you to find the reflected image `B`, given point `A` and mirror `m`. (Reflect Tool)</li>
		<li>Perpendicular Bisector Theorem: Given `P` on the perpendicular bisector `m` of `overline(AB)`, `|PA| = |PB|`.</li>
		<li>Converse of Perpendicular Bisector Theorem: Given `|PA| = |PB|`, with `P,` `A,` and `B` distinct, `P` lies on the perpendicular bisector `m` of `overline(AB)`.</li>
		<li>We will assume that reflection, as defined above, is an isometry (a rigid motion).</li>
	</ol>
	<p>These starting elements differ from the approach taken by the PCMI course, which defines reflection differently, as follows:</p>
	<p>For any line `m` in the plane, there exists an isometry `R_m` called "reflection in `m`" such that every point in `m` is mapped to itself, but there are no other fixed points.</p>
	<h4>Construction-Based Proof</h4>
	<p>Given: `tri ABC` and `tri DEF`, with `AB \cong DE`, `AC \cong DF`, and `BC \cong EF`.</p>
	<p>Prove: `tri ABC \cong tri DEF`.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>If `tri ABC` and `tri DEF` are both CW or both CCW, reflect `triABC` in `overlineAB`. Consider this reflected image to be `tri ABC` for the remainder of this argument. Now `tri ABC` and `tri DEF` are of opposite handedness.</li>
		<li>Construct the perpendicular bisector `k` of `overline(AD)`.</li>
		<li>Reflect `triABC` in `k`. Now `A'` is superposed on `D`.</li>
		<li>Construct the perpendicular bisector `m` of `overline(B'E)`.</li>
		<li>Perpendicular bisector `m` passes through the superposed point `A'`. The reasoning is that `|AB| = |DE|` (given), so `|A'B'| = |DE|` (reflection preserves distances). Because `A'` and `D` are superposed, `|A'B|' = |A'E|`. Therefore `A'` must lie on `m`, the perpendicular bisector of `B'E`. (Converse of the perpendicular bisector theorem).</li>
		<li>Reflect `triA'B'C'` in `m`. Now `B''` is superposed on `E`. Point `A'` lies on `m` and is its own reflected image, so `A'` and `A''` are both superposed on `D`.</li>
		<li>Each reflection (in `k` and `m`) has reversed the handedness of `triABC`, so `triA''B''C''` has the same handedness as `triABC` and is of opposite handedness from `triDEF`, with `A''` superposed on `D` and `B''` superposed on `E`.</li>
		<li>Construct the perpendicular bisector `n` of `overline(C''F`. By the converse of the perpendicular bisector theorem, it passes through `E`/`B''` (because `|BC| = |EF|`) and also through `D`/`A''` (because `|AC| = |DF|`). </li>
		<li>Reflect `triA''B''C''` in `n`. Both `A''` and `B''` remain fixed, since they lie on `n`, and `C'''` is now superposed on `F` (by the definition of reflection).</li>
	</ol>
	<p>The elements of the definition of reflection correspond nicely to tools. But the Perpendicular Bisector Theorem and its converse don't correspond as nicely to tools. This is presumably one place where Wayne's work with cards can play out strongly.</p>
	<p>[Might there be a tool we could invent for such a purpose? Though it's not within current WSP capability, what if the student could click a tool on `overline(AB)` and on `P`, and a text object appears that says either "`P` lies on the perpendicular bisector of `overline(AB)`, so `|PA| = |PB|`" or "`P` does not lie on the perpendicular bisector of `overline(AB)`, so `|PA| \ne |PB|`".]</p>
	<p>One way of connecting these approaches, I think, might be to have two types of cards: Cards that correspond to constructions, and cards that are used to explain certain consequences of the constructions. Though a drag test can be used to verify such consequences empirically, identifying the proper card has explanatory value that the drag test doesn't.</p>
	<h4>Activities</h4>
		<p>I've added two initial sketches, to review the definition of reflection and to review the Perpendicular Bisector Theorem and its converse.</p>

The Perpendicular Bisector Theorem
	<p>The vision for this sketch is that students should be able to think of this page, and this theorem, when they're about to do something that requires a point to be on a specific perpendicular bisector. The current plan is to implement a game in which students are presented with a figure in which two segments are attached by a common endpoint, and are asked to figure out whether it's possible to reflect one segment onto the other. They have available only the PBT Converse tool, so their job is to use that tool to figure out if the reflection is possible. After using the tool, they press a Predict button: ("I Predict: Yes" and "I Predict: No").</p>
	<p>After pressing the button, an animation appears: first the perpendicular bisector appears, and then the reflection is animated using the perpendicular bisector as its mirror. There's a New Case button that randomly gemerates a new case that either works or doesn't (and also undoes whatever tools the student has used).</p>
