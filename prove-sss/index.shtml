	<p>In this lesson you’ll prove an important geometric fact: The Side-Side-Side Theorem (SSS).</p>
<!--	<p style="border: 1px solid black; padding:0px 5px;">If the three sides of one triangle are respectively equal in length to the sides of another triangle, then the two triangles must be <em>congruent</em>.</p>
	<p>In Activities 1 and 2 review some information that will help you explain the proof. Your teacher may tell you to skip them if you're already familiar with the definition of reflection and the Perpendicular bisector Theorem.</p>
-->
	<p>In Activity 1 you will practice by constructing and proving a simpler theorem.</p>
	<p>In Activity 2, you will construct the superposition of SSS triangles, and you will explain how to use the steps of your construction to prove the SSS Theorem.</p>
	<p>In Activity 3, you will consider some other cases different from the triangles in Activity 2, and figure out how to make your proof from Activity 2 apply to these cases as well.</p>

			<p>Here’s one way to define <em>reflection:</em></p>
			<p>Dependent point `x'` is the reflection of independent point `x` in mirror `m` if and only if line `m` is the perpendicular bisector of segment `overline(x x')`.</p>
			<p>This definition works two ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If `x'` is the reflection of `x,` the mirror is the perpendicular bisector of `overline(x x').` (This means you can use Perpendicular Bisector tool to construct a mirror that reflects `x` to `w.`</li>
				<li>If `m` is the perpendicular bisector of `overline(x x')`, `x'` is the reflection of `x` in mirror `m.` (This means that when you use the Reflect tool to reflect `tri xyz` across `m,` point `x` will be reflected to `x'`.)</li>

			<p><strong>Other Cases for the SSS Theorem:</strong> In the previous activity, you used three examples to construct and prove the SSS Theorem. In all three of the examples `triABC` and `triDEF` were opposite-handed: one clockwise and one counter-clockwise. But what if the two triangles are similarly handed? How can you construct/prove the SSS theorem for similarly-handed triangles?</p>
			<p>In this activity you'll do just that, but instead of creating an entirely new proof you'll find a easier way, by using the proof you've already created.</p>
			<p><img src="/fc/includes/pencil.png" style="width: 1rem;"/> Why is it impossible to put two similarly-handed triangles into superposition using the same reflections you used for opposite-handed triangles?</p>
			<p><img src="/fc/includes/pencil.png" style="width: 1rem;"/> What's the simplest way you can transform `triABC` to make its image opposite-handed compared to `triDEF`?</p>
			<p><strong>On page 1</strong> transform `triABC` so that the image is opposite-handed to `triDEF`. Then use the construction from the previous activity to superpose an image of `triABC` onto `triDEF`.</p>
			<p><strong>Page 2</strong> contains a different example.</p>
			<p><img src="/fc/includes/pencil.png" style="width: 1rem;"/> As you do this construction, describe it and explain why it works. You can simplify your explanation by referring to the proof you created for opposite-handed triangles.</p>
			<p><strong>Page 3</strong> contains another special case for you to consider.</p>
